## Overview

### Definition
Likelihood is the probability of a given set of data $D$ having occurred under a particular hypothesis H:
$$\mathcal{L}(H,D)=â„™[D|H]$$
What this says is: We have some data that was generated by a process. We hypothesize that this process is a function (that has a "distribution") with parameters $\theta$ (_i.e._ the likelihood is a function of the unknown parameters). Given this distribution, we can test which parameters are most consistent with the data (the likelihood of the data given our parameters). This is fun to [visualize](https://seeing-theory.brown.edu/)
